# Setup

* Set up a virtualenv, which is a virtual python enviroment totally seperate from the rest of the system. This allows you to have different versions of various modules and to be sure that you only have those modules that you actually need:

 `virtualenv venv`

* Use the virtualenv. Always execute this command before you start working on this project, so that your current terminal session uses it:

`source ./venv/bin/activate`

* Install pygame:

 `pip install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame`
